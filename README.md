# procrustes

things to remember: 

have a startup.m in this root directory (git ignore it) containing run(directory of VL), eg

  run('/Users/valkyrie/libraries/vlfeat-0.9.20/toolbox/vl_setup')

if the ./triCheck executable doesnt work, compile the .cpp with g++ -std=c++11  -o triCheck triCheck.cpp

tags to be checked should be .jpgs in the /tags folder in the home directory

obj file and its associated texture .jpgs and .mtl should be in the /obj folder in the home directory
