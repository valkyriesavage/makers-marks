# procrustes

things to remember: 

have a startup.m in this root directory (git ignore it) containing run(directory of VL), eg

  run('/Users/valkyrie/libraries/vlfeat-0.9.20/toolbox/vl_setup')

if the ./triCheck executable doesnt work, compile the .cpp with g++ -std=c++11  -o triCheck triCheck.cpp
